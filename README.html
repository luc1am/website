            <p><strong>I am Lucia and I use they/them pronouns. </strong>
               <br><br>I am a Filipino-American creator, 
              and I grew up in Hawai’i on the island of O’ahu. My current art practice is fabrication.
               It combines everything I am interested
                in, the art of process, iterating on ideas and prototypes, working with new material,
                 but mostly I loved that I was able to make something I could really hold.
                 Being exposed to more machines such as the CNC router, 3D printing, laser cutting, 
                 and the Risograph, creates a flow of ideas that feels right. Fabrication, in its strength, 
                 combines a wide range of technology and skills in different mediums. In as many ways 
                 as possible, I am interested in building and fabricating in all my favorite mediums and more.</p>
